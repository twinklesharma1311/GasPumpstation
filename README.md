# GAS PUMP STATION
This is a Object-Oriented Software Engineering project.
The java application is a control system for a gas station pump. 

The software will control all aspects of the pumpâ€™s function like: 

- Validating the credit/debit card (if one is being used)
- Allowing the customer to select the grade of gasoline 
- Calculating and displaying the running total and amount of gas pumped
- Presenting the total (including taxes) to the user

The mechanism which controls the flow of the gas through the nozzle is assumed to be mechanical and is not controlled 
by this application. The application simply keeps track of the amount of gas that has been pumped.
The pump will also print a receipt and log the sale following completion.

The following list of documents was created for this project:
